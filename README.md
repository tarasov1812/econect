**Challange:** Tell Us a Climate Story!

**Description:** Our project, EcoNect, is based on raising awareness about the impact of greenhouse gases on our planet. This will be done through an application. When opened, the app will display a 3-minute video that tells the story of our planet. It shows how the Earth has been deteriorating and, as a last hope, the Earth asks for help from a little girl.
This girl represents hope for change and shows that we still have time to save the planet. As a solution, EcoNet is presented as a social network where you can discover ways to help the environment. It aims to promote sustainable development and make it accessible to all audiences.
